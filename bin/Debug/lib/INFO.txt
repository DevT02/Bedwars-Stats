STEPS TO USE:

1. Type "/api new" in chat. You will see something in chat something like "Your new API KEY is:........."

2. Wait for the program to grab the key or click "Get API"

3. Now, go into a bedwars lobby and do /who, click "Get Stats". (or wait for the program to grab)

4. Watch as everything loads :)

IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

This program will attempt to find the latest minecraft you use. If by chance you switch between 2 different minecraft clients (like badlion and vanilla), 
you should only open BedWars stats after launching the game. Thanks!
