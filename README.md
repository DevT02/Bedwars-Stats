# Bedwars Stats
- Get real-time stats of a bedwars game.
- Find sweats.
- Avoid them and win more often.
- Super external from minecraft. Open on your second monitor, or just pull up in between games without an annoying blockage.

# Features
- Color coding for different ranges of numbers
- Fast response time 
- Ranks
- Stars
- Finals
- Final Kill Death Ratio
- Win Loss Ratio
- In party?**
- Nicked People
- Support for vanilla, badlion, pvplounge, and lunar client. (Lunar is probably broken because its a weird client in terms of its chat logs).
- Right-click menu for individual gamemode stats (Finals, WLR, and FKDR)
- A super tiny list for bots. (To see bots: https://pastebin.com/raw/b5fZntN5). 

** This finds people in parties; it only works if you are in a party chat. That means if you were theoretically in all-chat, this would not detect it.

# How to use
  1. Type in hypixel chat: "/api new"
  2. Get in a bedwars lobby
  3. Type "/who"
  4. Profit!
  
# How does it work?

# FAQ
Q : Will I get banned for using this?

A : No. I contacted hypixel support a while ago, and they told me it was fine because it did not give an advantage and was just pulling up stats.
