- Ranks
- Stars
- Finals
- Final Kill Death Ratio
- Win Loss Ratio
- In party?**
- Nicked People
- Support for vanilla, badlion, pvplounge, and lunar client. (Lunar is probably broken because its a weird client in terms of its chat logs).
- Right-click menu for individual gamemode stats (Finals, WLR, and FKDR)
- A super tiny list for bots. (To see bots: https://pastebin.com/raw/b5fZntN5). 

** This finds people in parties; it only works if you are in a party chat. That means if you were theoretically in all-chat, this would not detect it.

  3. Type "/who"
  4. Profit!
  
  
# FAQ
Q : Will I get banned for using this?

A : No. I contacted hypixel support a while ago, and they told me it was fine because it did not give an advantage and was just pulling up stats.

# How does it work?
- Purely on chat logs. 
- The Hypixel API.
